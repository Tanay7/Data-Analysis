# This repository contains code examples for Data analysis using Python


## About this repository

* **Author:** Tanay C.
* **Focus:** This repo provides examples for manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching datasets in Python. It covers fundamental libraries like pandas, NumPy, IPython, and Jupyter, along with introductions to data visualization with matplotlib/seaborn and modeling with statsmodels/scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

These examples were run using Jupyter notebooks.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher (the book is updated for 3.10).
* Anaconda for managing packages and environments.


### Data Files

The datasets required for running the examples are included within the repository, often in a `datasets` directory.
